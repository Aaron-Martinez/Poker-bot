# Poker-bot
A game engine for texas holdem no limit with an AI computer player

Goals for the project:
1. Create a poker AI which will learn to play 6 max no limit holdem at a high level starting without any initial strategy input
2. Want poker-bot to become good enough to beat amateur/decent players (or myself) on average
3. Compare and contrast poker-bot playstyle with my own study and understanding of game theory optimal (GTO) play - specifically for 6 max no limit texas holdem
